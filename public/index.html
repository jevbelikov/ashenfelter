    <h2>Plots for the proposal</h2>

	<b>Plot 1</b> shows favourable years for wines in the Bordeaux region. 
	Low amount of rain during the harvest period (in mm) and high average temperatures 
	(in degrees Celsius) throughout the growth season are deemed favourable for wine 
	quality. For instance, year 2010 appears and indeed was a good year.

	<b>Plot2</b> illustrates some discrepancies between the average auction price
	and the value assigned to the vintage by the model (the values are not directly comparable). 
	On the left scale there is the price in US dollars for a recent auction (diamonds), whereas on 
	the right side there is the scale for the models predictions (circles). Blue circles show 
	the points where the prices and the estimates of value rather disagree. This may be due to some
	unreliability in the data (it may include cheaper wine and conflate the average
	price and the quantity of sales -- this information was no available) and due
	to some sensitivity of the model (which however was shown to work well with Bordeaux 
	wines). Another potential source of error is the climate data. We wish to investigate 
	these issues in the future using larger data sets and perhaps apply the same approach
	to different commodity markets.
