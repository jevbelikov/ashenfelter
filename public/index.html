	<b>Plot 1</b> shows favourable years for wines in the Bordeaux region. 
	Low amount of rain during the harvest period (in mm) and high average temperatures 
	(in degrees Celsius) throughout the growth season are deemed favourable for wine 
	quality. For instance, year 2003 appears and indeed was a good year.
